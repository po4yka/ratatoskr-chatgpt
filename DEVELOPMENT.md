# Developing Ratatoskr ChatGPT Archive

> Status: Proposed  
> Last reviewed: 2026-08-20

Architecture bootstrap: importer, parser registry, schema, Compliance adapter, storage, and portable exporter are not implemented.

## Intended toolchain

Rust/Tokio, safe ZIP/archive handling, streaming SHA-256, SQLx/PostgreSQL, content-addressed BlobStore, Serde/JSON Schema, NATS, fixture-driven parsers, tracing, and testcontainers.

## Code size limits

There is no code here yet, so no limit is enforced yet. The commit that brings the first manifest brings the configuration that carries the limits with it: `clippy.toml` beside a `Cargo.toml`, `eslint.config.js` beside a `package.json`. `fleet.yml` fails the gate when a manifest arrives without one, so the rule has a check behind it and not only this paragraph.

`ratatoskr-workspace/docs/QUALITY_GATES.md` holds the numbers the repositories with code use today, the command that measured each one, and the limits that were rejected with the reason. Read it before you choose numbers, then measure this tree. Each limit is set at the worst case the tree already has, so that the check fails on a regression and not on work that has not been done yet.

## Current validation

The docs-only OpenSpec checks and the Rust product gate both run. The full local
equivalent of CI is:

```bash
git diff --check
openspec validate --all --strict
openspec validate --archived
```

`.github/workflows/openspec.yml` runs the two OpenSpec commands in CI. The product gate lives in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` beside them; it needs a PostgreSQL for the schema integration tests.

### Rust — also the CI gate

```bash
cargo fetch --locked
cargo deny check
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo build --workspace --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

This list and the `- run: cargo` lines in `ci.yml`'s `gate` job are enforced identical by that
workflow's last step. `CHATGPT_TEST_DATABASE_URL` must point at a PostgreSQL 17 for
`crates/chatgpt-archive/tests/persistence_schema.rs`; without it those tests skip locally, while CI
always sets it from its service container.

## Workflow

1. Treat every export as hostile and persist the immutable raw archive before parsing.
2. Detect format/schema and choose an explicit versioned parser.
3. Preserve unknown records/content parts and produce a completeness report.
4. Reconcile projects, conversation graphs, revisions, files, Canvas/assets without overwriting history.
5. Test limits, traversal, duplicates, partial assets, interruption, privacy deletion, and portable export.

The first scaffold PR must document exact commands. Default tests use synthetic export fixtures and never ChatGPT login/session cookies or personal exports.

## What a clone needs before you plan a change

A change is planned with OpenSpec, which is a CLI a clone installs for itself. Use the version
`.github/workflows/openspec.yml` pins, so your terminal and the gate answer the same:

```bash
npm install --global @fission-ai/openspec@1.10.0
```

Cross-repository behaviour lives in a store, and registering one is per-machine state that no
repository can turn on for you — the same kind of step as `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:po4yka/ratatoskr-workspace.git <path>
openspec store register <path> --id ratatoskr-workspace
```

`openspec doctor` reports whether both are in place.

## The Rust skills in this repository

`.agents/skills/` holds eighteen Rust skills vendored from `po4yka/rust-skills`, and
`.claude/skills/` symlinks to them. Unlike the steps above this needs nothing from your machine: the
files are in the tree, so a fresh clone already has them.

Update them with the catalogue and never by hand:

```bash
npx skills update
```

That rewrites `.agents/skills/` and `skills-lock.json` from the catalogue. Run it in one repository,
read the diff, then apply the same change to every Ratatoskr repository whose stack is Rust.
`ratatoskr-workspace/.github/workflows/drift.yml` fails when one copy differs from the others.
